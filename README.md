# BitcoinChart
A simple app that fetches information about the bitcoin market.
This App uses a modular Architecture, then all the features are separated by modules. All the theoretical information that I used could be found here [in this link, a blog series written by Jeroen Mols](https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2019/03/06/modularizationwhy/)

Chart library: [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart)
